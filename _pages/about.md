I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Materials Science and Engineering at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** (Shanghai China), seeking for PhD position for 2020 Fall in **Materials Science & Engineering**. Since my junior year, I am priviledged to be supervised by <span style="color:blue">some **Professor Peng Zhang** text</span>. My recent work in Zhang's Lab focused on **Photoelectrochemical Energy Conversion System** combined with mesoporous catalytic materials. I have recently joined [Dr. Hall's Lab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/hall "Dr. Hall's Lab") at Johns Hopkins Univeristy as a visiting student led by [A. Shoji Hall](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=L98xBPAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
