I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Materials Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Shanghai, China), seeking for PhD position for 2020 Fall in **Materials Science & Engineering**. Since my junior year, I am priviledged to be supervised by <span style="color:FF7D00">**Professor Peng Zhang**</span>. My recent work in Zhang's Lab focused on **Photoelectrochemical Energy Conversion System** combined with mesoporous catalytic materials. I have recently joined <span style="color:FF7D00">[Dr. Hall's Lab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/hall "Dr. Hall's Lab")</span> at Johns Hopkins Univeristy as a visiting student led by <span style="color:FF7D00">[A.
